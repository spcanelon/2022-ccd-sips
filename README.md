# Philly Center City District Sips 2022: An Interactive Map
**An R tutorial created for [R-Ladies Philly](https://www.rladiesphilly.org/)**

!["Silvia Canelón presents Webscraping, Geocoding & Interactive Map-Making with Center City Sips Data. R-Ladies Philly."](https://www.meetup.com/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure-content.meetupstatic.com%2Fimages%2Fclassic-events%2F506372053%2F676x380.webp&w=3840&q=75)

Are you interested in learning how to work with geographic data? How to scrape data from the web? How to use an API to access data? How to plot your geographic data and make it all interactive and interesting? If so, this beginner-friendly workshop is for you.

Join us as Silvia Canelón provides a gentle introduction to web-scraping, geocoding and map-making in an end-to-end analysis. You'll learn how to scape the bar and restaurant data from the Center City Sips website and convert the addresses to latitude and longitude. You'll learn how to plot the geographic data onto a map and customize the visualization with {leaflet}. You'll even learn how to publish the interactive html output online using Quarto ([Check out the map](http://tiny.cc/ccdsips2022)!).

All of the code and the data will be available in an RStudio cloud project to make coding along even easier. This workshop is based on Silvia's previously shared [tutorial](https://silviacanelon.com/blog/2022-ccd-sips/#building-the-map).
